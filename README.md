## The Task
Week 1's homework involves the refactoring (i.e. editing and improvement) of the code of the Horiseon website.
We are to adhere to the Scout Rule: always leave the code a little better / cleaner than when you found it.

The accessibility standards of the website are viewed as important, and in need of improvement.  This also helps to optimize the website's searchability for a search engine such as Google.
For the task, we are given a list of acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
